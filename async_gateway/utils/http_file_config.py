The two cap primitives -- :func:`guard_declared_length` and

``helpers/internal/request_helper.py`` because both HTTP read paths need
them and ``helpers/`` may import ``utils/`` while the reverse direction
would be a layering inversion. One implementation means the transport
boundary and this module cannot disagree about what "too large" is, or
report it differently when they refuse (R14).

    Checked before a single body byte is read, so an endpoint announcing a
    gigabyte costs the caller one header parse rather than a gigabyte of
    allocation. A response that declares nothing -- a chunked one -- is not
    refused here; :func:`iter_capped` catches it mid-stream instead.

    A ``Content-Length`` that is not an integer is ignored rather than
    rejected: it is the remote side's framing error, the transport will
    fail on it in its own way, and turning it into a size failure here
    would report the wrong thing.

    A response that declares the header **more than once** is judged on
    the largest value it declared, and an unparseable one no longer stops
    the others being read. Both used to be decided by whichever line came
    first, so a conflicting pair -- itself a framing error, and the shape
    a smuggling attempt takes -- could put an over-sized declaration
    behind a small one and pass a guard whose whole job is to refuse it
    before the read.
